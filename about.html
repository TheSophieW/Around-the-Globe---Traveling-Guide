        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>At Around the Globe, we don’t just explore; we curate experiences. What started as a passion for travel
            turned into a mission—to bring the world’s most exclusive destinations, hidden gems, and elite experiences
            to travelers who crave more than just a vacation.
            <br>
            We're the team behind the journey, blending a love for adventure, a deep appreciation for culture, and a
            commitment to luxury travel. Whether it’s a private sunset yacht cruise in Santorini, a Michelin-starred
            culinary tour through Paris, or an off-grid, VIP safari in Africa, we believe travel should be seamless,
            immersive, and unforgettable.

                <p class="title">Experience Architect & Logistics Virtuoso</p>
                <p>
                    With over a decade in the world of elite hospitality and private event curation, Guy is the calm
                    behind
                    the
                    scenes — the one who ensures every moment unfolds seamlessly. From coordinating private jet
                    itineraries
                    across five time zones to orchestrating candlelit dinners on remote Aegean cliffs, he’s mastered the
                    art
                    of
                    precision wrapped in elegance.

                    Guy’s background spans luxury concierge services, boutique hotel consulting, and executive-level
                    planning
                    for high-profile clients. But what sets him apart is his philosophy: “Luxury isn’t about excess —
                    it’s
                    about
                    intention.”

                    At Around the Globe, Guy designs journeys where timing, ambiance, and experience align to create the
                    unforgettable — every time.

                    With a keen eye for detail and a deep love for storytelling, Sophie founded Around the Globe as a
                    way to
                    bring meaningful, elevated travel to those who seek more than just destinations — but moments of
                    beauty,
                    intention, and wonder.

                    At 27, she brings a rare blend of creative vision and hands-on experience, weaving design, culture,
                    and
                    emotion into every journey. From the elegance of old-world Europe to the stillness of hidden
                    temples,
                    Sophie
                    believes that travel, when curated thoughtfully, becomes a form of art.

                    Whether she’s writing, designing, or dreaming up the next signature escape, her purpose remains
                    clear:
                    to
                    craft experiences that feel both personal and unforgettable.

                    historic alleys, or the perfect golden-hour shot. His work reminds us that luxury isn't just
                    tradition —
                    it's evolution.

            <h2>Why We Created Around the Globe</h2>
            <p>Because travel should be more than just "visiting places." It should be a story you live, a memory you
                can
                feel, and an experience that stays with you forever.

                Whether you’re seeking relaxation, adventure, culture, or culinary indulgence, we’ve done the research,
                made
                the connections, and built the bridge—you just need to take the first step.

                <br> So, where will your journey take you next?
